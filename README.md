# QAVAN: <i>Query-Answering Approach for Actionable Numerical Relationships over Knowledge Graphs</i>

## Description
QAVAN is a query-answering approach to perform mathematical formulas on demand over Knowledge Graph (KG) data based on Semantic Web technologies. QAVAN exploit the Advanced Features of the W3C recommendation SHACL to that goal. Given a query QAVAN is able to compute on the fly only the mathematical formulas on the specific instances involve in these query. Thus, avoiding the problem of disk space and memory that could produce a full materialisation.
