# QAVAN: <i>Query-Answering Approach for Actionable Numerical Relationships over Knowledge Graphs</i>

## Description
QAVAN is a query-answering approach to perform mathematical formulas on demand over Knowledge Graph (KG) data on based Semantic Web technologies. QAVAN exploit the Advanced Features of the W3C recommendation SHACL to that goal. This approach is able to compute only the mathematical formulas for the specific instances involve in a query. Thus, avoiding the problems in disk space and memory that could produce a full materialisation.
